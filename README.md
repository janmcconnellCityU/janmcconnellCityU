I am a business analyst completing an MS in Data Science (March 2026). My work focuses on structured analysis of operational and financial data using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI. I build reproducible workflows that turn messy, relational data into interpretable signals for decision support.

I have spent much of my career supporting finance, operations, and project portfolios, often inheriting messy data, unclear processes, or tools that were never quite fit for purpose. I enjoy untangling those situations and leaving things better documented, more transparent, and easier to maintain.

## 🔍 How I Work

I am detail-oriented, skeptical in a healthy way, and more interested in correctness than flash (but I do appreciate a good visualization). I value tools that have stood the test of time and use newer ones when they actually add something. I tend to ask questions others skip, usually because those unanswered questions turn into problems later.

I care a lot about clarity: clear data, clear assumptions, clear explanations. If someone cannot understand the output, the work is not finished.
