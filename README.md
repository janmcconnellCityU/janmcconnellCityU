# About me

I am a business analyst with a history of working where data, process, and decision-making meet. I am currently completing my **MS in Data Science** program and expect to graduate in **2026**. My work tends to live in the practical middle ground: not theory for its own sake, not dashboards for decoration, but analysis that helps people understand what is actually happening and what to do next.

I have spent much of my career supporting finance, operations, and project portfolios, often inheriting messy data, unclear processes, or tools that were never quite fit for purpose. I enjoy untangling those situations and leaving things better documented, more transparent, and easier to maintain.

## What I work on

- Data analysis and visualization, especially with **Excel** and **Power BI**
- ETL, data cleanup, and making disparate data sources usable
- Process analysis and improvement, particularly in operational and financial contexts
- Portfolio, project, and workflow reporting
- Documentation, training, and translating technical details into plain language

## How I work

I am detail-oriented, skeptical in a healthy way, and more interested in correctness than flash (but I do appreciate a good visualization). I value tools that have stood the test of time and use newer ones when they actually add something. I tend to ask questions others skip, usually because those unanswered questions turn into problems later.

I care a lot about clarity: clear data, clear assumptions, clear explanations. If someone cannot understand the output, the work is not finished.

## What you will find in this GitHub

This GitHub contains a mix of coursework, experiments, and practical examples related to data analysis and data science, including:

- Python notebooks and scripts focused on data analysis, modeling, and exploration
- SQL and data preparation work
- Examples of analytical thinking applied to real or realistic problems
- Work that emphasizes clarity, documentation, and reproducibility over clever shortcuts

Repositories may reflect learning in progress as well as refined work.

## A few personal notes

- 👩 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ I genuinely enjoy building spreadsheets and reports, even when nobody asked me to
- 🔭 I believe good analysis should reduce noise, not add to it
